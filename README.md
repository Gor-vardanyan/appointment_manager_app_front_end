In the project you can register and make appointmets with clients
login with doctor acount and see your clients and appointmets

### This project is deployed in Heroku :
Through the main page you can only login with the client
to login with doctor or admin you have to add to the url "/docotor" or "/admin" to have acces to it's login
the first loading of the page usualy takes long because the region of the server is in the US, if it fails just reload the page.
